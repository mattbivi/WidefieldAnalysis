# Widefield analysis of Mouse brain imaging
Using the hardware setup as described in (paper), we have developed a processing and visualisation ecosystem in python to allow one to process data exported from the Hamamatsu camera system, after converting to tiff files. 

## Package requirements
Developed in python 3.10 using:
- numpy
- OpenCV (v4.5)
- scipy
- tifffile
- matplotlib
- pandas

for those on unix systems, you can install via 
´´´´
pip3 install numpy OpenCV==4.5.5.64 scipy tifffile matplotlib pandas
´´´´
